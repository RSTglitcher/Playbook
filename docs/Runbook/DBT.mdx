:::tip dbt
dbt (data build tool) is a **data transformation tool** that enables analysts and engineers to transform raw data into a clean, analysis-ready format in the data warehouse.
It solves problems related to **modular SQL, testing, version control, and reproducibility** of transformations.

How to use dbt as TA
--------------

# Review project structure, models, and sources
# Examine DAG (directed acyclic graph) to understand model dependencies
# Validate test coverage and data quality checks (uniqueness, not null)
# Check source freshness and warehouse refresh schedule
# Review pull requests or CI logs for failed runs
# Inspect documentation generated via dbt
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve

**How to formulate requirements when working with dbt**

* Gather warehouse credentials and environment variables
* Identify which models, sources, and tests are in scope
* Collect DAG dependencies and assess downstream impact
* Validate access control for environments (dev, staging, prod)
* Determine CI/CD integration requirements (e.g., Git hooks, dbt Cloud jobs)
* Establish what TAs need to provide engineers for troubleshooting, release verification, and handover

## Pre-Requisites

| Action / Service            | What TA Needs to Gather / Confirm                                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Set-up                      | dbt installed locally / CI runners configured                                   |
| Access & Login              | Warehouse credentials, environment variables, dbt Cloud account (if applicable) |
| API                         | dbt Cloud API token if interacting programmatically                             |
| Other tool-specific actions | Warehouse connectivity, Git repository containing dbt project, CI/CD setup      |

## Engineering

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="skill" label="Skill">

```shell
--------------
Common ways engineers use dbt
--------------

# Run dbt models in development
dbt run

# Test dbt models
dbt test

# Compile SQL without execution
dbt compile

# Generate and serve documentation
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve

# Run models incrementally
dbt run --models +model_name

# Run only selected models
dbt run --models tag:finance
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="engineering" label="Engineering">

**How to formulate a plan for development**

* Identify which models, sources, and tags are relevant for work
* Document DAG dependencies and their owners
* Establish test coverage requirements for models and transformations
* Define what TAs need to provide for model validation, release, or CI/CD handover
* Track performance and warehouse resource usage for incremental runs
* Include guidance for handling broken tests, failing runs, and documentation updates

## Triage

| Symptom                        | TLDR of Root Cause                            | What to Check                         | Action to Propose                                               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Models failing                 | SQL errors, missing tables, broken references | dbt run logs, warehouse schema        | Fix SQL, update references, rerun                               |
| Tests failing                  | Data quality or constraints violated          | dbt test output, model source data    | Correct data or model logic, rerun tests                        |
| DAG dependency broken          | Model dependency misconfigured or deleted     | dbt graph, DAG visualization          | Update dependencies, verify DAG, rerun                          |
| Documentation not updating     | dbt docs generate not run or failed           | dbt docs logs, artifacts              | Regenerate docs and serve                                       |
| CI/CD pipeline failing         | Git issues, environment misconfig             | CI logs, dbt profiles                 | Fix CI config, validate environment                             |
| Slow runs / warehouse overload | Large incremental loads, high cardinality     | dbt run timing, warehouse performance | Optimize queries, shard incremental runs, adjust warehouse size |
