:::tip Grafana
**Grafana** is an open-source **visualization and analytics platform**.
It is primarily used to **create dashboards, query metrics, and visualize time-series data** from sources like Prometheus, Loki, or InfluxDB, helping engineers and TAs monitor systems and detect anomalies.

```shell
--------------
How to use Grafana as a TA
--------------

# Log in via web UI or CLI
# Review dashboards and panel layouts
# Drill down into panels to investigate anomalies or trends
# Review alert rules, thresholds, and notification channels
# Check data sources and their scrape intervals
# Validate dashboard ownership, folder structure, and access permissions
# Audit panel queries for efficiency and correctness
# Confirm alerts are firing and delivered to recipients
# Identify missing metrics or misconfigured panels
```

**How to formulate requirements when working with Grafana**

* Identify which dashboards or visualizations are critical to monitor
* Gather details on data sources, their owners, and scrape intervals
* Determine alerting and notification requirements
* Confirm user access roles and API key requirements
* Establish what TAs need to provide to engineers for dashboard or alert maintenance
* Validate compliance or audit requirements (log retention, dashboards history)

## Pre-Requisites

| Action / Service        | What TA Needs to Gather / Confirm                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Server / SaaS Setup     | Self-hosted or SaaS instance, URL/account link, provisioning status, instance owner        |
| Access & Login          | Users, roles (Viewer/Editor/Admin), group memberships, SSO/local auth enabled              |
| API Access              | API keys issued, expiration/rotation policies, scopes assigned                             |
| Data Sources Config     | Connected sources (Prometheus, Loki, InfluxDB, etc.), owner, scrape intervals, permissions |
| Dashboards / Panels     | Key dashboards, owners, panel documentation, folder/tagging structure                      |
| Alerts & Notifications  | Configured alert rules, channels (Slack, PagerDuty, email), escalation policies, owners    |
| Observability & Metrics | Internal metrics, audit logs, retention periods and owners                                 |
| Environment / Network   | URL access restrictions (VPN/firewall), reverse proxy/load balancer, SLAs                  |

## Engineering

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="skill" label="Skill">

```shell
--------------
Common ways engineers use Grafana
--------------

# Add or configure data sources
# Create/update dashboards and panels
# Define and update alerting rules
# Export dashboards/JSON for version control
# Integrate with notification channels (Slack, PagerDuty, email)
# Apply user role management and permissions
# Verify Grafana version --> grafana-server --version
# List installed plugins --> grafana-cli plugins list
# Install plugins --> grafana-cli plugins install <plugin-id>
# Reset admin password --> grafana-cli admin reset-admin-password <pw>
# Use API for automation:
#   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" https://<grafana-url>/api/dashboards/home
#   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" https://<grafana-url>/api/datasources
```

**How to formulate a plan for development**

* Map all critical dashboards and data sources
* Document ownership of dashboards, panels, and alert rules
* Define engineering handover: API keys, access roles, folder structure
* Include monitoring and alerting touchpoints for system issues
* Specify rollback or remediation steps for misconfigured dashboards or failed alerts
* Ensure compliance requirements are met (audit logs, retention, history)

## Triage

| Symptom           | TLDR of Root Cause                                 | What to Check                                      | Action to Propose                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| UI not loading    | Grafana server down or network issue               | Server logs, pod status (if K8s), firewall         | Restart server/pod, check network            |
| Dashboards empty  | Data source misconfigured or unavailable           | Verify data source connection, scrape intervals    | Reconfigure source, validate credentials     |
| Alerts not firing | Alert rules misconfigured or notifications blocked | Check alert rule evaluation, notification channels | Correct rules or channel settings            |
| Slow performance  | High cardinality metrics or overloaded server      | Query performance, dashboard complexity            | Optimize queries, limit panels, scale server |
| Access denied     | User role or API key issue                         | Check role, API key validity                       | Adjust roles, regenerate API key             |
