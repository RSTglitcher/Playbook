Platform's/Topic's **core services, setup steps, and terminology** needed to understand engineering designs, estimates, and platform constraints.
:::

## Overview

Platform / Technology is a **cloud platform / framework / system type** used to primary purpose.

As a TA, your role is to understand:

* What engineers must configure
* Which components interact
* Where complexity and risk live
* Why estimates include “platform work”

## TA Checklist (Quick Review)

* [ ] Environments clearly separated
* [ ] Permissions scoped correctly
* [ ] Observability configured
* [ ] Cost risks understood
* [ ] Failure modes discussed

## Core Concepts (Foundational)

### Core Concept 1

**What it is:**
Concise definition in plain language.

**Why engineers care:**

* Reason 1
* Reason 2

**TA red flags:**

* Common source of hidden complexity
* Misconfiguration risks

---

### Core Concept 2

**What it is:**
Short explanation.

**Why engineers care:**

* Availability, scale, security, or cost implications

---

## Data & Storage (Engineering-Level)

### Service / Component

**What it actually is:**

* Technical reality (not marketing)

**Engineering setup includes:**

* Permissions / access
* Configuration
* Lifecycle / retention

**TA questions:**

* Usage patterns?
* Retention or compliance needs?
* Who owns failures?

---

## Databases / State Management

### Database / Store

**What it is:**

* Type (OLTP / OLAP / key-value / stream)

**Design reality:**

* How schema or access patterns drive design

**TA red flags:**

* Incorrect usage assumptions
* Scale or consistency mismatches

---

## Compute & Workloads

### Compute Model

**Key constraints:**

* Runtime limits
* State management
* Scaling model

**TA questions:**

* Is execution predictable?
* Where does state live?

---

## Messaging & Integration

### Messaging / Integration Service

**What it is:**

* Point-to-point / pub-sub / event-driven

**Engineering setup includes:**

* Retry behaviour
* Failure handling
* Permissions

---

## Observability

### Monitoring / Logging

**Covers:**

* Logs
* Metrics
* Alerts

**TA red flags:**

* No alerts
* No retention policy

---

## Networking (Often Hidden Work)

### Networking Component

**Why it matters:**

* Security boundaries
* Connectivity

**TA indicators of complexity:**

* Private networking
* Cross-system connectivity

---

## Cost & Limits

**Platform realities:**

* Quotas
* Pricing model
* Scaling costs

**TA role:**

* Identify unbounded usage
* Validate assumptions behind estimates
