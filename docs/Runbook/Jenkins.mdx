:::tip Jenkins
**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server used to **build, test, and deploy software**.
It supports continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines and integrates with a wide range of plugins to automate repetitive engineering tasks.

--------------
How to use Jenkins as a TA
--------------

# Verify Jenkins server is running
# Check key pipelines and last build results
# Review pipeline configurations (ownership, triggers, notifications)
# Inspect console logs for failed builds or failed steps
# Identify integrations (SCM, artifact repository, deployment targets)
# Validate access control for users and service accounts
# Monitor job queue for stuck or delayed builds
# Ensure observability (metrics, alerts, notifications) are functional
```

<TabItem value="requirements" label="Requirements">

**How to formulate requirements when working with Jenkins**

* Identify which teams/pipelines require TA oversight
* Determine critical pipelines, build agents, and notification channels
* Gather information on SCM repositories, artifact repositories, and deployment targets
* Confirm access levels for the TA (roles, API tokens, service accounts)
* Identify audit or compliance requirements (pipeline history, logs retention)
* Establish what handover information engineers need: credentials, pipeline ownership, and plugin dependencies

## Pre-Requisites

| Action / Service       | What TA Needs to Gather / Confirm                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Set-up                 | Jenkins server type (self-hosted or SaaS), cluster/pod info if containerized, responsible engineer/owner |
| Access & Login         | User roles (Viewer/Editor/Admin), authentication method (LDAP, SSO, local accounts)                      |
| API                    | API token availability if scripts or automation access is needed                                         |
| Pipeline Configuration | Existing pipeline definitions, names, owners, notifications setup                                        |
| Plugins / Integrations | Installed plugins, source control (Git, SVN), artifact repositories, deployment environments             |

## Engineering

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="skill" label="Skill">

```shell
--------------
Common ways engineers use Jenkins
--------------

# Trigger builds manually or via SCM hooks
# Configure new pipelines using Jenkinsfile (Declarative or Scripted)
# Configure build agents/nodes for distributed execution
# Install and manage plugins for integrations (Git, Slack, Docker, Kubernetes)
# Access console output/logs for builds
# Set up notifications for build failures or successes
# Schedule periodic or parameterized jobs
# Integrate with artifact repositories, test suites, and deployment pipelines
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="engineering" label="Engineering">

**How to formulate a plan for development**

* Map existing pipelines, build agents, and plugin usage
* Document pipeline dependencies, notifications, and integration points
* Define engineering handover: credentials, plugin versions, SCM connections, artifact paths
* Include monitoring/alerting touchpoints for failed builds or stuck jobs
* Establish rollback or remediation steps for critical pipelines

## Triage

| Symptom                | TLDR of Root Cause                                       | What to Check                                  | Action to Propose                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Server down            | Jenkins service stopped or container/pod crashed         | Service/pod status, logs                       | Restart service/pod, check memory/CPU                        |
| Pipeline fails         | Broken steps, missing credentials, or environment issues | Console output, pipeline config, credentials   | Fix pipeline steps, update credentials, validate environment |
| Jobs stuck             | Build queue backlog or blocked agents                    | Queue status, agent availability               | Free up agents, restart stuck jobs                           |
| Plugins failing        | Incompatible or outdated plugin                          | Plugin manager, version compatibility          | Update/fix plugin, verify dependencies                       |
| Access issues          | User roles or authentication misconfigured               | User roles, SSO/LDAP settings                  | Adjust permissions, troubleshoot auth                        |
| Notifications not sent | Misconfigured notifications or credentials               | Job notifications config, Slack/email settings | Correct notification settings or credentials                 |
