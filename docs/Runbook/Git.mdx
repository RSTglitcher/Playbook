:::tip Git
**Git** is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code, collaborate across teams, manage branches, and coordinate deployments.
It solves problems related to source code history, collaboration, and version management.

How to use Git as a TA
--------------

# Clone repository and inspect structure
git clone <repo_url>
cd <repo_name>

# Explore branches and commit history
git branch -a
git log --oneline --graph
git show <commit_hash>

# Compare changes
git diff <commit1> <commit2>

# Inspect remotes
git remote -v

# Validate workflows and recent changes
git fetch
git status

# Review forks for contributions
git remote show origin
```

**How to formulate requirements when working with Git**

* Gather repository URLs, branch structures, and ownership
* Determine branching strategy (GitFlow, trunk-based, release branches)
* Identify CI/CD integration points and PR policies
* Collect commit/PR templates and required reviewers
* Validate authentication methods (SSH, HTTPS tokens) and rotation policies
* Establish what TAs need to provide engineers for merges, releases, or audits

## Pre-Requisites

| Action / Service     | What TA Needs to Gather / Confirm                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Repository Access    | Repo URL, branch structure, owners/maintainers, read/write permissions, protected branches |
| Authentication       | SSH keys, HTTPS tokens, OAuth, token/key validity and rotation, credential owner           |
| Branching / Workflow | Naming conventions, mainline strategy, pull request process, code review requirements      |
| Commit / PR Policies | Commit message/PR templates, pre-commit hooks, CI/CD enforcement, required reviewers       |
| Optional Tooling     | IDE or GUI clients used (VS Code Git, SourceTree, GitKraken)                               |

## Engineering

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="skill" label="Skill">

```shell
--------------
Common ways engineers use Git
--------------

# Branching and workflow
git checkout -b feature-branch
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin feature-branch

# Collaboration
git pull origin main
git merge feature-branch
git rebase main

# Forking workflow
# Fork repo to own namespace
# Clone fork and add upstream remote
git remote add upstream <original_repo_url>
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main

# Resolve conflicts
git status
git diff
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add <file>
git commit

# Tagging and releases
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release v1.0"
git push origin v1.0
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="engineering" label="Engineering">

**How to formulate a plan for development**

* Identify which branches, forks, or tags are relevant for work
* Document repository ownership and access for each branch
* Establish merge/rebase strategy and release cadence
* Define what TAs need to provide for branch merges, release verification, or CI/CD handover
* Include guidance for handling conflicts and code reviews
* Track compliance or audit requirements (commit history, PR approvals)

## Triage

| Symptom                     | TLDR of Root Cause                             | What to Check                                  | Action to Propose                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Cannot clone repository     | Wrong URL, network issue, or permission denied | Repository URL, network connectivity, SSH keys | Correct URL, check network, validate keys  |
| Merge conflicts             | Concurrent edits to same files                 | `git status`, diff conflicting files           | Resolve conflicts manually, commit changes |
| Push rejected               | Remote branch protected, missing commits       | Remote branch policy, `git log`                | Pull latest changes, rebase or merge       |
| Detached HEAD               | Checked out commit instead of branch           | `git status`                                   | Checkout correct branch                    |
| Untracked or missing files  | Files ignored, deleted, or not added           | `git status`, `.gitignore`                     | Add missing files, adjust `.gitignore`     |
| Commit not showing remotely | Local changes not pushed                       | `git status`, `git log`                        | Push changes to remote                     |
| Authentication fails        | SSH key or token expired/misconfigured         | `ssh -T git@host`, token validity              | Update SSH key or token                    |
| Slow operations             | Large repo, large files, network latency       | Repo size, network performance                 | Shallow clone, optimize repo, use LFS      |
