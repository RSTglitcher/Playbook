:::tip Regular Expressions
Regular Expressions (Regex) define **patterns** used to search, match, extract, validate, and transform text.

They are used across **CLI tools, programming languages, configuration files, and observability pipelines**.
:::

Regular Expressions define patterns to search, match, and manipulate text strings.

Use Cases:
- Text search & filtering
- Data validation
- Data extraction
- Text replacement & formatting
- Log analysis
- URL routing & rewriting
- Parsing
- Refactoring
- Security
- Automated text filtering
- Cleaning
- Data masking

### Examples

```shell
Social Security Number:
^\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}$

Email (simple):
\b\w+@\w+\.\w+\b

Email (strict):
^[a-zA-Z0-9._]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+[._]*@[a-zA-Z0-9._]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+[._]*\.[a-zA-Z]+

Colours:
(red|blue|green)

IPv4 Address:
\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}
```

### Common Regex Functions

```shell
.match     -> Match
.search    -> Search
.replace   -> Replace
```

### Characters

```shell
.    -> Any single character except newline
\d   -> Digit (0-9)
\w   -> Word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _)
\s   -> Whitespace
\S   -> Non-whitespace
\    -> Escape special character
```

### Quantifiers

```shell
{n}     -> Exactly n occurrences
{n,}    -> At least n occurrences
{n,m}   -> Between n and m occurrences
+       -> One or more
++      -> One or more (greedy)
+?      -> One or more (lazy)
*       -> Zero or more
**      -> Zero or more (greedy)
*?      -> Zero or more (lazy)
?       -> Zero or one
^       -> Start of line
$       -> End of line
.*      -> Any number of characters
[^]     -> Any character NOT in range
```

### Specific Patterns

```shell
(abc)        -> Exact sequence
(a|b)        -> a OR b
[^abc]       -> Not a, b, or c
[a-z]        -> Lowercase letters
[A-Z]        -> Uppercase letters
(?i)         -> Case-insensitive mode
(?s)         -> Single-line mode
(?m)         -> Multi-line mode
(?x)         -> Free-spacing / comment mode
[aeiou]      -> Any vowel
[^XYZ]       -> Any character except X, Y, Z
[a-z0-9]     -> Character range
()           -> Capturing group
[]           -> Character class
[^]          -> Negated character class
```

### Modifiers

```shell
i   -> Case insensitive
g   -> Global matching
m   -> Multi-line matching
-w  -> Match whole word
-v  -> Invert match
-n  -> Line number
-c  -> Count matches
-B  -> Before context
-A  -> After context
-C  -> Context (before + after)
```

### Extended Regex

```shell
#EGREP
!         -> NOT
||        -> OR
-o        -> Shell OR
&&        -> AND
-a        -> Shell AND
*         -> Match 0 or more
?         -> Match 1 character
[]        -> Range
{}        -> Lists / counts
[a-e]     -> Match a through e
[!0-9]    -> Anything except digits
^         -> Start of line
$         -> End of line
.         -> Single character
[^]       -> Any character not in range
.*        -> Any number of characters
\         -> Escape meta character
+         -> One or more occurrences
(a|b)     -> Match a or b
```
