:::tip Jenkins Platform Runbook
An **engineering-aware reference** for Technical Analysts working with Jenkins-based CI/CD platforms.

Focuses on **core services, setup steps, and terminology** needed to understand delivery pipelines, estimates, operational risk, and platform constraints.

## Overview

Jenkins is a **continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD) automation server** used to build, test, and deploy software.

As a TA, your role is to understand:

* What engineers must configure beyond “just pipelines”
* Which components Jenkins depends on
* Where delivery risk and operational cost live
* Why estimates often include “CI/CD work”

Jenkins is powerful but **not opinionated by default**, meaning teams must design, secure, and operate it correctly.

## Core Concepts (Foundational)

### Jobs & Pipelines

**What it is:**  
A **pipeline** defines the steps Jenkins executes (build, test, deploy). Pipelines are often written as code (`Jenkinsfile`).

**Why engineers care:**

* Enables repeatable builds and deployments
* Version-controlled delivery logic
* Supports complex workflows and approvals

**TA red flags:**

* Pipelines defined only in the UI (not in code)
* Large, monolithic pipelines doing too much
* No separation between build, test, and deploy

---

### Jenkinsfile

**What it is:**  
A text file (usually in Git) describing pipeline stages and steps.

**Why engineers care:**

* Enables review, versioning, and rollback
* Makes CI/CD part of the software lifecycle

**TA red flags:**

* Jenkinsfile copied between repos without standardisation
* Environment-specific logic hardcoded
* Secrets embedded directly in the file

---

## Data & Storage (Engineering-Level)

### Workspace & Build Artifacts

**What it actually is:**

* Temporary workspace on Jenkins agents
* Optional storage for build outputs (artifacts)

**Engineering setup includes:**

* Disk allocation on agents
* Artifact retention policies
* Cleanup of old builds

**TA questions:**

* How long are artifacts retained?
* Where are build outputs stored long-term?
* What happens when disks fill up?

---

## Databases / State Management

### Jenkins Internal State

**What it is:**

* File-based state (job configs, build history, credentials)
* Often stored on local disk or shared storage

**Design reality:**

* Jenkins is **stateful**
* Backups and recovery must be planned explicitly

**TA red flags:**

* No backup strategy
* Single-node Jenkins with no recovery plan
* Assumption that Jenkins is “stateless like the cloud”

---

## Compute & Workloads

### Build Agents (Nodes)

**Key constraints:**

* Limited CPU, memory, and disk
* Tools must be preinstalled or provisioned dynamically
* Jobs compete for agent capacity

**TA questions:**

* Are agents static VMs, containers, or ephemeral?
* What happens when all agents are busy?
* Are builds queued during peak times?

---

## Messaging & Integration

### SCM, Artifact Repos, Deployment Targets

**What it is:**

* Integrates with Git, Docker registries, cloud platforms, APIs
* Uses webhooks, polling, and credentials

**Engineering setup includes:**

* Webhook configuration
* Credential management
* Retry and failure behaviour

**TA red flags:**

* Hardcoded credentials
* No retry or timeout strategy
* Manual triggers replacing automation

---

## Observability

### Monitoring / Logging

**Covers:**

* Build logs
* Job success/failure metrics
* Agent health

**TA red flags:**

* No alerts on failed pipelines
* Logs retained indefinitely (or not at all)
* No visibility into queue length or agent saturation

---

## Networking (Often Hidden Work)

### Jenkins Connectivity

**Why it matters:**

* Jenkins must reach source control, registries, environments
* Often crosses network boundaries

**TA indicators of complexity:**

* Private Git repositories
* On-prem ↔ cloud connectivity
* Firewalls blocking agents or webhooks

---

## Cost & Limits

**Platform realities:**

* Cost driven by:
    * Agent infrastructure
    * Storage for artifacts and logs
* Jenkins itself is free, but **operations are not**

**TA role:**

* Identify unbounded build growth
* Question “always-on” agents
* Validate assumptions around parallel builds

```shell
# Check Jenkins service status (example)
systemctl status jenkins

# List running Docker agents (if container-based)
docker ps

# Verify Java version (Jenkins dependency)
java -version

# Disk usage check (common failure mode)
df -h

# ----------------------------
# Jenkins sanity & availability
# ----------------------------

# Check Jenkins service status (Linux systemd)
systemctl status jenkins

# Check if Jenkins is listening on the expected port (default 8080)
ss -ltnp | grep 8080
# or
netstat -ltnp | grep 8080

# Simple health check (HTTP 200 expected)
curl -I http://localhost:8080/login


# ----------------------------
# Jenkins process & resources
# ----------------------------

# Find Jenkins process and JVM details
ps aux | grep jenkins

# Check Java version Jenkins is running on
java -version

# Check memory usage of the Jenkins process
jps -lvm
jstat -gcutil $(pgrep -f jenkins) 1s 5

# Check disk usage (common Jenkins failure mode)
df -h
du -sh /var/lib/jenkins/*


# ----------------------------
# Plugins & configuration
# ----------------------------

# List installed plugins (if Jenkins CLI is available)
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080 list-plugins

# Check Jenkins version
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080 version


# ----------------------------
# Jobs, queues, and agents
# ----------------------------

# Check build queue length (via REST API)
curl -s http://localhost:8080/queue/api/json | jq '.items | length'

# List connected agents (nodes)
curl -s http://localhost:8080/computer/api/json | jq '.computer[].displayName'

# Check agent online/offline status
curl -s http://localhost:8080/computer/api/json | jq '.computer[] | {name: .displayName, offline: .offline}'


# ----------------------------
# Build health & failures
# ----------------------------

# List recent builds for a job
curl -s http://localhost:8080/job/JOB_NAME/api/json | jq '.builds[:5]'

# Check last build result
curl -s http://localhost:8080/job/JOB_NAME/lastBuild/api/json | jq '.result'


# ----------------------------
# Credentials & permissions (high-level)
# ----------------------------

# Verify who you are authenticated as (API token required)
curl -u user:API_TOKEN http://localhost:8080/whoAmI/api/json | jq '.authenticated'


# ----------------------------
# Logs & troubleshooting
# ----------------------------

# Jenkins main log (path may vary)
tail -f /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log

# Agent logs (example)
docker logs jenkins-agent-name
