:::tip Jenkins
Jenkins is an **open-source automation server** used to build, test, and deploy software.
It supports continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines and integrates with a wide range of plugins to automate repetitive engineering tasks.
:::

---

## When to use

* Automate building, testing, and deploying code changes.
* Orchestrate multi-stage pipelines for software delivery.
* Integrate with source control, testing frameworks, and deployment platforms.

**Do NOT use this tool when:**

* Simple scripts or manual processes suffice.
* Cloud-native CI/CD services are already fully used (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD) unless you need self-hosting or specific plugins.

## TA Skills Checklist

- Confirm Jenkins is installed and running for the team/project.
- Verify pipeline ownership and access permissions.
- Ensure logs, metrics, and alerts are available for analysis.
- Understand integration points with source control, artifact repositories, and deployment targets.

## Pre-Requisites

| Action / Service       | What TA Needs to Gather / Confirm |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Set-up                 | Jenkins server type (self-hosted or SaaS), cluster/pod info if containerized, responsible engineer/owner |
| Access & Login         | User roles (Viewer/Editor/Admin), authentication method (LDAP, SSO, local accounts) |
| API                    | API token availability if scripts or automation access is needed |
| Pipeline Configuration | Existing pipeline definitions, names, owners, notifications setup |
| Plugins / Integrations | Installed plugins, source control (Git, SVN), artifact repositories, deployment environments |

How to use Jenkins as a TA
--------------

# Verify Jenkins server is up
# Check status of key pipelines and their last build results
# Review pipeline configurations for ownership, triggers, and notifications
# Inspect logs for failed builds or failed steps
# Identify integration points: SCM, artifact repository, deployment targets
# Validate access control for users and service accounts
# Monitor job queue for stuck or delayed builds
# Ensure observability (metrics, alerts, notifications) are functional
```

--------------
Common ways engineers use Jenkins
--------------

# Trigger builds manually or via SCM hooks
# Configure new pipelines using Jenkinsfile (Declarative or Scripted)
# Configure build agents/nodes for distributed execution
# Install and manage plugins for integrations (Git, Slack, Docker, Kubernetes)
# Access console output/logs for builds
# Set up notifications for build failures or successes
# Schedule periodic or parameterized jobs
# Integrate with artifact repositories, test suites, and deployment pipelines

## Triage

:::danger
Symptoms of issues with Jenkins and how to triage this:
:::

| Symptom                | TLDR of Root Cause                               | What to Check                         | Action to Propose                               |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Server down            | Jenkins service stopped or container/pod crashed | Service/pod status, logs              | Restart service/pod, check memory/CPU        |
| Pipeline fails          | Broken steps, missing credentials, or environment issues | Console output, pipeline config, credentials | Fix pipeline steps, update credentials, validate environment |
| Jobs stuck              | Build queue backlog or blocked agents          | Queue status, agent availability      | Free up agents, restart stuck jobs           |
| Plugins failing         | Incompatible or outdated plugin                | Plugin manager, version compatibility | Update/fix plugin, verify dependencies      |
| Access issues           | User roles or authentication misconfigured     | User roles, SSO/LDAP settings         | Adjust permissions, troubleshoot auth        |
| Notifications not sent  | Misconfigured notifications or credentials     | Job notifications config, Slack/email settings | Correct notification settings or credentials |
