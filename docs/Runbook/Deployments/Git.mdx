:::tip Git
A **distributed version control system** used to track changes in source code, collaborate across teams, manage branches, and coordinate deployments. Solves problems related to source code history, collaboration, and version management.
:::

---

## When to use

* Need to track code changes over time
* Collaboration across multiple developers
* Managing branching, releases, or feature development

**Do NOT use this tool when:**

* Simple file versioning is sufficient
* Binary files or non-source data is the main focus (use object storage or Git LFS)

## TA Skills Checklist

- Navigate repositories to understand branch structure and history
- Identify ownership of branches and critical merges
- Validate workflows (pull requests, CI/CD integration)
- Surface potential risks of conflicts or unreviewed changes

---

## Pre-Requisites

| Action / Service       | What TA Needs to Gather / Confirm |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Repository Access      | Correct repository URL, branch structure, repo owner/maintainers, access permissions (read/write), protected branches |
| Authentication         | Method in use (SSH key, HTTPS token, OAuth), token/key validity, rotation policy, who manages credentials |
| Branching / Workflow   | Branch naming conventions, mainline strategy (e.g., GitFlow, trunk-based), pull request process, code review requirements |
| Commit / PR Policies   | Any commit message or PR template rules, pre-commit hooks, CI/CD enforcement, reviewers required |
| Optional Tooling       | GUI clients or IDE integrations used by team (e.g., SourceTree, GitKraken, VS Code Git) |

## Business As Usual

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="capabilities" label="TA Skills">

```shell

# Check repository structure
git clone <repo_url>                 # Clone repository locally
cd <repo_name>                        # Navigate into repository

# Inspect branches and history
git branch -a                         # List all branches
git log --oneline --graph             # Review commit history visually

# Understand recent changes
git diff <commit1> <commit2>          # Compare changes between commits
git show <commit_hash>                 # Show commit details

# Check remote configuration
git remote -v                         # See remote URLs

# Validate merge and pull request workflows
git fetch                              # Update remote refs
git status                             # Check working directory state
```

<TabItem value="execution" label="SWE Skills">


```shell
# Branching and workflow
git checkout -b feature-branch         # Create and switch to a new branch
git add .                              # Stage changes
git commit -m "Description of changes" # Commit staged changes
git push origin feature-branch         # Push branch to remote

# Collaboration
git pull origin main                    # Pull latest main branch changes
git merge feature-branch                # Merge feature branch into main
git rebase main                         # Rebase feature branch onto main

# Resolving conflicts
git status                              # Identify conflicted files
git diff                                # Inspect conflicts
# Edit conflicted files manually
git add <file>                          # Mark conflict resolved
git commit                              # Complete merge

# Tagging and release
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release v1.0"      # Create annotated tag
git push origin v1.0                    # Push tag to remote
```

## Triage

:::danger
Symptoms of issues with Git and how to triage:
:::

| Symptom                     | TLDR of Root Cause                          | What to Check                                | Action to Propose                           |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Cannot clone repository      | Wrong URL, network issue, or permission denied | Repository URL, network connectivity, SSH keys | Correct URL, check network, validate keys |
| Merge conflicts              | Concurrent edits to same files             | `git status`, diff conflicting files        | Resolve conflicts manually, commit changes |
| Push rejected                | Remote branch protected, missing commits  | Remote branch policy, `git log`             | Pull latest changes, rebase or merge       |
| Detached HEAD                | Checked out commit instead of branch      | `git status`                                | Checkout correct branch                     |
| Untracked or missing files   | Files ignored, deleted, or not added      | `git status`, `.gitignore`                  | Add missing files, adjust `.gitignore`     |
| Commit not showing remotely  | Local changes not pushed                   | `git status`, `git log`                     | Push changes to remote                      |
| Authentication fails         | SSH key or token expired/misconfigured    | `ssh -T git@host`, token validity           | Update SSH key or token                     |
| Slow operations              | Large repo, large files, network latency  | Repo size, network performance              | Shallow clone, optimize repo, use LFS      |
