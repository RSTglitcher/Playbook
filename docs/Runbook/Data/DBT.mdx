:::tip dbt
dbt (data build tool) is a **data transformation tool** that enables analysts and engineers to transform raw data into a clean, analysis-ready format in the data warehouse. It solves problems related to **modular SQL, testing, version control, and reproducibility** of transformations.
:::

---

## When to use

* You need to maintain a **transformational layer** in your data warehouse with versioned, tested SQL.
* You want **modular and reusable SQL pipelines**.
* You need **testing, documentation, and lineage** for analytics tables.

**Do NOT use this tool when:**

* You need **EL or ingestion** workflows (use Airflow, Fivetran, etc.).
* Simple queries or ad-hoc transformations suffice.

## TA Skills Checklist

- Understand the dbt project structure, models, and sources.
- Validate tests and data quality checks.
- Review DAGs and dependencies for impact assessment.
- Ensure access control and environment separation.
- Identify potential performance or scaling issues.

## Pre-Requisites

| Action / Service       | What TA Needs to Gather / Confirm |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Set-up                 | dbt installed locally / CI runners configured |
| Access & Login         | Warehouse credentials, environment variables, dbt Cloud account (if applicable) |
| API                    | dbt Cloud API token if interacting programmatically |
| Other tool-specific actions | Warehouse connectivity, Git repository containing dbt project, CI/CD setup |

How to use dbt as TA
--------------

# Review dbt models, sources, and tests
# Examine DAG (directed acyclic graph) to understand model dependencies
# Validate test coverage and quality (e.g., uniqueness, not null)
# Check source freshness and warehouse refresh schedule
# Review pull requests or CI logs for failed runs
# Inspect documentation generated via `dbt docs generate` and `dbt docs serve`
```

Common ways engineers use dbt
--------------

# Run dbt models in development
dbt run

# Test dbt models
dbt test

# Compile SQL without execution
dbt compile

# Generate and serve documentation
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve

# Run models incrementally
dbt run --models +model_name

# Run only selected models
dbt run --models tag:finance

## Triage

:::danger
Symptoms of issues with dbt and how to triage this:
:::

| Symptom                   | TLDR of Root Cause                  | What to Check                                  | Action to Propose |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Models failing             | SQL errors, missing tables, broken references | dbt run logs, warehouse schema | Fix SQL, update references, rerun |
| Tests failing              | Data quality or constraints violated | dbt test output, model source data | Correct data or model logic, rerun tests |
| DAG dependency broken      | Model dependency misconfigured or deleted | dbt graph, DAG visualization | Update dependencies, verify DAG, rerun |
| Documentation not updating | dbt docs generate not run or failed | dbt docs logs, artifacts | Regenerate docs and serve |
| CI/CD pipeline failing     | Git issues, environment misconfig | CI logs, dbt profiles | Fix CI config, validate environment |
| Slow runs / warehouse overload | Large incremental loads, high cardinality | dbt run timing, warehouse performance | Optimize queries, shard incremental runs, adjust warehouse size |
