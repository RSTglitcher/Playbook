:::tip Grafana
Grafana is an **open-source visualization and analytics platform**. It is primarily used to **create dashboards, query metrics, and visualize time-series data** from sources like Prometheus, Loki, or InfluxDB, helping engineers and TAs monitor systems and detect anomalies.
:::

---

## When to use

* You need a visual interface to monitor metrics from multiple sources
* You want to create dashboards for observability and alerting
* You need to correlate data across services and time-series

**Do NOT use this tool when:**

* You only need raw log aggregation without visualization (consider Loki or Elasticsearch)
* Lightweight metrics queries without dashboards suffice

---

## TA Skills Checklist

- Understanding of data sources (Prometheus, Loki, InfluxDB, etc.)
- Ability to read dashboards and detect anomalies
- Knowledge of access control, API keys, and SSO
- Awareness of alerting rules and thresholds

## Pre-Requisites

| Action / Area             | What TA Needs to Gather / Confirm |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Server / SaaS Setup        | Is Grafana self-hosted or SaaS? Server URL or account link, provisioning status, who owns the instance |
| Access & Login             | Users, roles (Viewer / Editor / Admin), group memberships, SSO or local auth enabled, account owner |
| API Access                 | API keys issued, expiration / rotation policies, scopes assigned |
| Data Sources Configuration | Which data sources are connected (Prometheus, Loki, InfluxDB, etc.), owner of each datasource, scrape intervals, permissions |
| Dashboards / Panels        | Key dashboards to review, who owns them, documentation / description of panels, tagging or folder structure |
| Alerts & Notifications     | Configured alert rules, channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty), ownership of alerts, escalation policies |
| Observability & Metrics    | Are internal metrics logged? Are audit logs enabled? Retention periods and owners |
| Environment / Network      | URL access restrictions (VPN / firewall), load balancer, reverse proxy setup, service availability SLAs |

## Business As Usual

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="capabilities" label="TA Skills">

```shell
# Log in to Grafana via web UI or CLI
# Navigate dashboards to understand metrics, panels, and visualizations
# Drill-down on panels to investigate anomalies or trends
# Review alert rules, thresholds, and notification channels
# Check which data sources are configured and their scrape intervals
# Validate dashboard ownership, folders, and access permissions
# Audit panel queries for efficiency, correctness, and relevance
# Confirm alerts are firing correctly and delivered to intended recipients
# Spot missing metrics, unusual trends, or misconfigured panels

```

</TabItem> <TabItem value="execution" label="SWE Skills">

```shell
# Add or configure data sources
# Create and update dashboards with queries and visualizations
# Define alerting rules based on metrics thresholds
# Export dashboards or JSON configuration for version control
# Integrate with notification channels (Slack, PagerDuty, email)
# Use Grafana API for automated dashboard provisioning
# Apply user role management and permissions
# Check Grafana version --> grafana-server --version
# List installed plugins -->  grafana-cli plugins list
# Install plugin -->  grafana-cli plugins install <plugin-id>
# Reset admin password -->  grafana-cli admin reset-admin-password <pw>
# API access:  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" https://<grafana-url>/api/dashboards/home

:::danger Failure Scenarios
Symptoms of issues with Grafana and how to triage them:
:::

| Symptom           | TLDR of Root Cause                             | What to Check                                      | Action to Propose                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UI not loading     | Grafana server down or network issue         | Server logs, pod status (if K8s), firewall      | Restart server/pod, check network         |
| Dashboards empty   | Data source misconfigured or unavailable     | Verify data source connection, scrape intervals | Reconfigure source, validate credentials  |
| Alerts not firing  | Alert rules misconfigured or notifications blocked | Check alert rule evaluation, notification channels | Correct rules or channel settings         |
| Slow performance   | High cardinality metrics or overloaded server | Query performance, dashboard complexity         | Optimize queries, limit panels, scale server |
| Access denied      | User role or API key issue                    | Check role, API key validity                     | Adjust roles, regenerate API key          |
