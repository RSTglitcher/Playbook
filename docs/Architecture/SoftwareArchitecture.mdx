## Terminal

Macs have a terminal that offers a command prompt for the user to directly interact with the shell.

## Shell

The Shell provides users with access to the Operating System (e.g. UNIX, Mac-OS, MACH, MS-DOS, MS-WINDOWS) and the
Filesystem within. You can navigate the filesystem to interact more directly with processes that sit in the Kernal.
