Used by Architectural Patterns: **SOA & Microservices**
- Specialised loosely coupled services
- SOA = larger, coarse-grained, centralised
- Microservices = fine-granes, de-centralised

Each service is discrete. One service can be replaced, enhanced or dropped without affecting any other service in the architecture.
