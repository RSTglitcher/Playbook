### Source Code Management (SCM):

- Version control systems, including Git, serve as the backbone for SCM in CI/CD. Developers use Git to manage and collaborate on source code changes. CI/CD systems pull the source code from version control repositories to build, test, and deploy applications.

### Continuous Integration (CI):

- CI involves automatically building and testing code changes whenever they are committed to the version control system. CI systems monitor the version control repository for changes and trigger automated builds and tests to ensure the code's integrity.

### Version Tagging and Release Management:

- Git is often used to tag specific versions of the codebase (e.g., releases) using tags. CI/CD pipelines can be configured to trigger specific actions (e.g., deployment to production) based on the creation of new version tags.

### Branching Strategies:

- Git's branching features are essential for implementing branching strategies in CI/CD. Developers can use feature branches for new features or bug fixes, and CI/CD systems can automate the testing and integration of these branches.

### Artifact Management:

- CI/CD pipelines often produce build artifacts (e.g., compiled binaries, Docker images). These artifacts can be versioned and stored in artifact repositories, with references to specific versions maintained in the version control system.

### Deployment Configuration:

- Deployment configurations, such as environment-specific settings or infrastructure as code, are often stored alongside the application code in the version control system. CI/CD pipelines reference these configurations to deploy applications consistently across different environments.

### Collaboration and Code Reviews:

- Collaboration features of Git, including pull requests or merge requests, facilitate code reviews. CI/CD systems can be configured to trigger additional checks or tests before allowing a pull request to be merged, ensuring code quality.


### GIT FILE SYSTEM

    - Working directory = Contains all the files that are a part of our project.
        - Initialise a Git repository = A hidden directory is created inside the working directory called .Git.
          Monitors and track all files added to the project.
          git add * = put the state of the file that was just added to the project into a staging area within
          the project wd. Records the state using SHA1 hashes. No physical movement, but the status
          is updated from the staging area to a feature/master branch

    - COMMIT_EDITMSG = Plain text file containing the messages for each commit to the repository. Each line in the file
      is in order of the commit.

   -HEAD = Plain text file that contains a reference to the current branch that you are working on.

   -config = Contains the configuration information about your repository, such as the developer's username and email address.

   -description = Plain text file that contains the name of the repository. Typically used by Git web, a web front end
   to Git that you can install.

   -hooks = Contains scripts that you can create to set up some automated tasks that can be run during some particular
   phases of the Git process.

   -index = link between the database and what is currently sitting in the working directory.

   -rest directory = reference files in folders for the branches and tags of your repository.
