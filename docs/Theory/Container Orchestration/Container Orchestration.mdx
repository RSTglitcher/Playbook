:::danger **Best Practices for Technical Analysts**
- Understand namespaces, ConfigMaps, and Secrets when requesting infrastructure changes.
- Know which workload type suits your application (stateless vs stateful).
- Be aware of autoscaling implications on resource consumption and cost.
- Ask engineers about cluster-level policies (RBAC, network policies, quotas).
- Recognize the difference between configuration objects (ConfigMaps) and persistent storage (PersistentVolumes).

## Orchestrators

- Platforms that manage containers across clusters.

### Kubernetes

- Open-source container orchestration platform.
- Automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized workloads.
- Provides declarative APIs, service discovery, self-healing, and rolling updates.

### Docker Swarm

- Native orchestration for Docker.
- Simpler than Kubernetes, suited for small clusters or simpler deployments.

### Nomad

- Lightweight orchestrator from HashiCorp.
- Integrates with Consul and Vault for service discovery and secrets management.

##Core Concepts

### Pods

- Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- Groups one or more containers that share storage, network, and spec.
- Useful for tightly coupled services.

### Services

- Stable network endpoint for pods.
- Enables service discovery and load balancing.

### Namespaces

- Virtual clusters inside a physical cluster.
- Provide isolation and resource quotas for teams or environments.

### ConfigMaps

- Store non-sensitive configuration as key-value pairs.
- Mounted into pods as files or environment variables.
- Not storage — used for runtime configuration.

### Secrets

- Like ConfigMaps but for sensitive data (passwords, keys).
- Stored in etcd, optionally encrypted.

## Workload Types

### Deployments

- Declarative updates for stateless applications.
- Handles scaling, rolling updates, and rollbacks.

### StatefulSets

- Manages stateful applications.
- Provides stable network IDs and persistent storage for pods.

### DaemonSets

- Ensures one pod runs on each node (or subset of nodes).
- Common for logging or monitoring agents.

### Jobs / CronJobs

- Run tasks to completion.
- CronJobs allow scheduled execution.

## Scheduling & Scaling
### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

- Scales pods based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.
- Helps maintain performance under variable load.

### Cluster Autoscaler

- Adds/removes nodes based on pod demand.
- Works with cloud providers for dynamic resource management.

### Affinity & Tolerations

- Control which nodes pods can schedule on.
- Useful for hardware constraints, zones, or taints.

## Observability & Management
### Logs & Metrics

- Centralized logging (ELK, Fluentd) and monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana).
- Essential for debugging and performance tuning.

### Health Checks

- Liveness probes: detect and restart unhealthy pods.
- Readiness probes: signal when pods are ready to serve traffic.

### Rollouts & Rollbacks

- Manage deployments with minimal downtime.
- Declarative configuration ensures reproducibility.

### Debugging Tools

- kubectl for cluster management.
- k9s for interactive terminal UI.
- Port-forwarding, exec, and logs commands for pod inspection.

Common Tools & Examples
Tool / Platform	Definition	Use Case
Kubernetes	Open-source orchestration platform	Production container deployments, scaling, service management
Docker Swarm	Native Docker orchestration	Simple container clusters, dev/test environments
Nomad	Lightweight orchestrator	Integration with HashiCorp stack for deployments
Helm	Kubernetes package manager	Manage deployments and dependencies
k9s	Terminal UI for Kubernetes	Cluster inspection and debugging
Prometheus/Grafana	Metrics collection & visualization	Observability and alerting
Fluentd / ELK	Log collection and aggregation	Centralized logging and troubleshooting
Where Container Orchestration fits architecturally

Application Containers → Orchestrator (Kubernetes/Swarm/Nomad) → Cluster Nodes (VMs / Cloud Instances / Bare Metal) → Storage & Network Abstractions

Supports: Stateful apps, stateless microservices, CI/CD pipelines

Integrates with: Persistent storage, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Service Mesh

Does not replace: databases, caches, or analytics systems
