### Use Cases
1. Data
2. Schema

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="json" label="JSON - JavaScript Object Notation">

Syntactically similar to JavaScript code - can easily be sent between computers and other programming languages.
Possible to store JavaScript objects as text.
Readable and lightweight. Good alternative to XML as less formatting is required.
Easily share, store, and work with data.

Uses human-readable text for storing and transmitting data objects containing attribute value pairs and arrays.
- organised
- easy to access

Data is written in key:value pairs. Values can include -
- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Array
- null / white space - JSON ignores whitespace between its elements.

  Built in Functions:
  convert JSON strings to JavaScript objects --> JSON.parse()
  convert object to JSON String --> JSON.stringify()

JSON is a lightweight data interchange format.
It is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
JSON is often used to transmit data between a server and a web application, as well as for configuration files.

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York",
  "isStudent": false,
  "courses": ["Math", "English", "History"]
}

```

<TabItem value="xml" label="XML - eXtensible Markup Language">

Markup language used to store & transport data. Self descriptive writing.
A way to store accessible data that can be read by both humans and machines.
Requires much more text so is longer in length and more time consuming to read and write.
Must be parsed with an XML parser.

Desiged to store data, used to transfer data. Allows you to define markup elements and generate customized markup language.

Data can include -
- CANNOT use Arrays

Requirements/Capabilities:
Requires end tags.
Convert to XML:

XML is a markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
It is widely used for representing structured data and exchanging information between systems.

```xml
<person>
  <name>John Doe</name>
  <age>30</age>
  <city>New York</city>
  <isStudent>false</isStudent>
  <courses>
    <course>Math</course>
    <course>English</course>
    <course>History</course>
  </courses>
</person>

```
