:::tip Definition
**OpenAPI** is a standard specification for describing HTTP APIs as a machine-readable contract. It defines *what an API exposes*, *how it is called*, and *what it returns*, independent of how the API is implemented.
:::

OpenAPI is primarily concerned with **clear communication and shared understanding** between API producers and consumers, rather than runtime behaviour.

Typical examples include:

* Defining REST APIs for internal platform use
* Publishing interactive API documentation to Backstage
* Validating API contracts in CI/CD pipelines

---

## Benefit / What problem does it solve?

Using **OpenAPI** enables:

* A shared, versioned contract between API providers and consumers
* Consistent, auto-generated API documentation
* Reduced ambiguity and reliance on tribal knowledge
* Tooling automation such as validation, mocking, and client generation


## Relationship to APIs (REST, GraphQL, SOAP)

OpenAPI is **not an API style** like REST or GraphQL.

Instead, it operates at a different layer:

* **API styles** (REST, GraphQL, SOAP, gRPC) define *how systems communicate at runtime*
* **OpenAPI** defines *how an HTTP API is described, documented, and agreed upon*

In practice:

* OpenAPI most commonly **describes REST-style HTTP APIs**
* It does **not replace REST** — it documents it
* GraphQL APIs are typically self-describing and do **not** use OpenAPI
* SOAP APIs historically used **WSDL**, which plays a similar role to OpenAPI

For a Technical Analyst, this distinction is important:

> OpenAPI explains *what an API looks like and how to use it*, not *how the API is implemented internally*.

## When to Use

**Use OpenAPI when:**

* You are exposing an HTTP API to other teams or services
* API consumers need clear, reliable documentation
* API behaviour must be validated automatically
* APIs are part of a shared platform or product ecosystem

**Typical examples:**

* Publishing API definitions to Backstage
* Validating request/response schemas in CI
* Generating client SDKs

---

## When Not to Use

**Avoid OpenAPI when:**

* The interface is not HTTP-based
* The API is short-lived and strictly private
* A simple README or inline documentation is sufficient
* The API is GraphQL-first (where schema introspection is native)

---

## Key Terminology & Definitions

* **Specification** – A formal, versioned description of an API
* **Contract** – The agreed behaviour between API provider and consumer
* **Path** – An API endpoint (e.g. `/orders/{id}`)
* **Operation** – An HTTP method on a path (GET, POST, etc.)
* **Schema** – A structured definition of request or response data

* Specification generated from existing code
* Faster initial adoption
* Higher risk of leaking implementation details

## Key Strategies

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="contractdriven" label="Contract-driven">

* Treat OpenAPI as a source of truth
* Enforce validation in CI/CD pipelines
* Align teams around agreed API behaviour

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="documentation" label="Documentation-first">

* Focus on discoverability and clarity
* Publish specifications to portals like Backstage
* Optimise developer experience

## How to Interact With It

* **Access pattern:** Declarative YAML or JSON files
* **Operations / Interfaces:** HTTP methods, schemas, security definitions
* **Interaction model:** Authored manually, generated from code, and validated by tooling

---

## What Do Results Normally Look Like

* Interactive API documentation
* Machine-readable API specification files
* Validation errors or warnings during CI/CD execution

**Notes:** OpenAPI defines *expected behaviour*, not runtime guarantees. Specs must be kept in sync with deployed APIs to remain trustworthy.
