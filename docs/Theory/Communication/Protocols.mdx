:::tip Definition
Protocols define **rules and conventions for communication between systems or components** in software engineering.
:::

Typical examples include:
- HTTP / HTTPS for web communication
- TCP / UDP for transport-level communication
- WebSockets for real-time bidirectional messaging


## HTTP Methods

| Method | Meaning / Purpose                                      |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | Retrieve a resource; should not modify server state    |
| POST   | Create a new resource or submit data to a server       |
| PUT    | Update an existing resource or create it if it doesn’t exist |
| PATCH  | Apply partial modifications to a resource             |
| DELETE | Remove a resource                                      |
| HEAD   | Retrieve headers only, no body                        |
| OPTIONS| Discover available HTTP methods for a resource        |
| CONNECT| Establish a tunnel to a server (used for proxies)     |
| TRACE  | Echo the received request for diagnostic purposes      |


## HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code Class | Meaning / Description                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1xx (Informational) | Request received, continuing process                                                |
| 2xx (Success)       | Action successfully received, understood, and accepted (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created) |
| 3xx (Redirection)   | Further action needed to complete request (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently, 302 Found) |
| 4xx (Client Error)  | Request contains an error (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found) |
| 5xx (Server Error)  | Server failed to fulfill a valid request (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error)         |

## Benefit / What problem does it solve?

Using Protocols enables:

- **Interoperability:** Different systems and platforms can communicate reliably
- **Consistency:** Messages are interpreted in a predictable, agreed-upon format
- **Control:** Provides mechanisms for error handling, sequencing, and flow control

---

## When to Use

**Use Protocols when:**

- Multiple systems need to communicate over a network
- Communication reliability, ordering, or format is important
- You need to define standard interfaces for integration

**Typical examples:**

- Web applications interacting with backend services (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Real-time dashboards and live notifications (WebSockets)
- IoT devices communicating with a central server (MQTT, CoAP)

---

## When Not to Use

**Avoid Protocols when:**

- Components run in the same memory space and can use direct function calls
- Performance is extremely latency-sensitive and protocol overhead is unacceptable
- Low-level device-specific communication that bypasses standard protocols

---

## Key Terminology & Definitions

- **Protocol** – A set of rules defining how data is formatted, transmitted, and interpreted
- **Transport Layer** – The layer responsible for end-to-end communication (TCP, UDP)
- **Application Layer** – Defines higher-level communication semantics (HTTP, WebSockets)
- **Handshake** – Initial negotiation between communicating parties to establish connection
- **Encryption / Security** – Mechanisms to protect data in transit (TLS, SSL)

---

## Variants / Types

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="http" label="HTTP / HTTPS">

- **Key characteristics:** Request-response model, stateless by default, widely supported
- **Example tools / libraries:** cURL, Postman, Axios, Fetch API
- **Primary purpose / benefit:** Standard for web communication; HTTPS adds encryption

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="tcp-udp" label="TCP / UDP">

- **Key characteristics:** TCP is connection-oriented and reliable; UDP is connectionless and low-latency
- **Example tools / libraries:** Sockets API, Netcat, Wireshark
- **Primary purpose / benefit:** Enables transport-layer communication with reliability (TCP) or speed (UDP)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="websocket" label="WebSockets">

- **Key characteristics:** Full-duplex, bidirectional communication over a single TCP connection
- **Example tools / libraries:** Socket.IO, ws (Node.js), native browser WebSocket API
- **Primary purpose / benefit:** Real-time messaging for dashboards, notifications, and chat systems

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="iot-protocols" label="IoT / Lightweight Protocols">

- **Key characteristics:** Lightweight, optimized for low-bandwidth or constrained devices
- **Example tools / libraries:** MQTT, CoAP
- **Primary purpose / benefit:** Efficient communication for IoT and embedded systems

## Key Strategies

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="reliable-comm" label="Reliable Communication">

- Ensure ordered delivery and error recovery (TCP, acknowledgment patterns)
- Responsibility: Guarantee message delivery between systems
- Focus / goal: Prevent data loss and maintain system integrity

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="low-latency" label="Low-Latency / Real-Time Communication">

- Use protocols optimized for speed, possibly at the cost of reliability (UDP, WebSockets)
- Responsibility: Enable real-time responsiveness
- Focus / goal: Fast, efficient communication for real-time applications

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="secure-comm" label="Secure Communication">

- Encrypt data in transit using TLS/SSL or similar mechanisms
- Responsibility: Protect confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data
- Focus / goal: Prevent eavesdropping and tampering

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## How to Interact With It

- **Access pattern:** Request-response, publish-subscribe, streaming, or bidirectional
- **Operations / Interfaces:** HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), WebSocket messages, TCP/UDP sockets
- **Interaction model:** Direct client-server calls, message brokers, or peer-to-peer

---

## What Do Results Normally Look Like

- Structured data (JSON, XML, Protobuf) delivered reliably or in real-time
- Acknowledgments, error codes, or retransmissions depending on the protocol
- Encrypted traffic when using secure protocols (HTTPS / TLS)

**Notes:**
- Choice of protocol affects latency, throughput, reliability, and security
- Many protocols can be layered (e.g., WebSockets over TCP, HTTPS over TCP/IP)
- Proper error handling and retry strategies are essential for robust communication
