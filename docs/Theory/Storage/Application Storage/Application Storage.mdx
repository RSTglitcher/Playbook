title: "Application Storage"

:::tip Application Storage
refers to the collection of storage systems and resources that applications use to **persist, retrieve, or manage data** during their operation.

**Application Storage**
Unlike **analytics or warehouse storage**, which focuses on large-scale reporting or historical analysis, application storage is concerned with **day-to-day operational data**, configuration, and stateful workload support.

Application storage encompasses:

- **Databases** – structured, semi-structured, and time-series storage
- **Container & platform storage** – persistent volumes, ephemeral storage, and configuration (e.g., ConfigMaps, Secrets)
- **File & object storage** – block devices, file shares, object stores for application data
- **Performance-oriented storage** – caches and search engine indices
- **Archival storage** – cold storage for long-term retention of application data

## When to Consider Application Storage

You should evaluate **application storage** when:

- Your application requires **persistent state** beyond the lifetime of a process or container
- Data must survive **system restarts or failures**
- You need **structured access** (databases) or **filesystem/block access** (platform storage)
- You need to **accelerate read access** for hot data (caching) or **searchable access** (search engine storage)
- You need to **retain logs, artifacts, or backups** for compliance or audit

---

## When to Use Application Storage

Use application storage when:

- You are running **stateful applications** (databases, message brokers, CI/CD tooling)
- Data must survive **pod restarts, crashes, or redeployments**
- Applications require **file, block, or object interfaces**
- You need to **support read-heavy or write-heavy workloads**
- You want **platform-managed lifecycle and consistency guarantees**

**Examples:**

- Relational databases running inside Kubernetes
- Message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ
- Stateful microservices
- Configuration storage (ConfigMaps, Secrets)
- Persistent volumes for CI/CD artifacts

### Key Takeaways for Technical Analysts

- **Application storage is about data and state for running applications**, not analytics.
- It supports **resiliency, durability, and operational efficiency**.
- Choosing the right type depends on **access pattern**, **durability requirements**, and **performance needs**.
- It forms the foundation for **caching, search, database, and archival strategies** explored in the sub-pages.
