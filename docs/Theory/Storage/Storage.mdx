## Analytics & Warehousing

Storage designed for large-scale analytical workloads, reporting, and historical analysis.

### Cloud Data Warehouses / Analytical Databases
  Used for querying and analysing large volumes of structured or semi-structured data. Optimised for read-heavy, analytical workloads.
  Covers the concepts of block storage and object storage as essential cloud storage solutions, useful for storing large volumes of structured or unstructured data. (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, EBS).
  Discusses cloud-based data warehouses and databases, focusing on structured data and large-scale data storage/analysis (e.g., SQL-based solutions, NoSQL, cloud-native databases like BigQuery, Redshift, and Snowflake).

### Data Warehouses
Discusses solutions for large, unstructured datasets or files (e.g., Distributed File Systems like Ceph, GlusterFS, or Data Lake solutions like Hadoop HDFS, and MinIO).

### Data Lakes


## Application Storage

Storage used directly by applications and services to persist operational data.

### Container & Platform Storage

### Kubernetes Persistent Storage
  Persistent volumes and storage abstractions used by containerised workloads running in Kubernetes.
  Focuses on storage needs in containerized environments, particularly within Kubernetes. This would include managing persistent storage for containerized apps (e.g., Persistent Volumes, StatefulSets).

### Databases

Structured storage systems optimised for querying, indexing, and transactional workloads.

### Structured Data
  Relational databases with fixed schemas and strong consistency guarantees.

### Semi-Structured Data
  Flexible-schema databases such as document stores and key-value stores.

### Time-Series Data
  Databases optimised for time-stamped, sequential, or metric-based data.
  Covers specialized databases for time-series data, commonly used in IoT, monitoring, or real-time analytics (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus).

### File & Object Storage

Storage systems for binary data, files, and large unstructured objects.

### Block Storage
  Low-latency storage typically attached to compute instances.

### Object Storage
  Scalable storage for unstructured data such as media, backups, and artifacts.

## Performance-Oriented Storage

Specialised storage designed to improve application performance and data access speed.

### Cache Storage
  Fast, temporary storage for frequently accessed data.
  Addresses the need for fast, temporary storage solutions (e.g., Cache Storage with Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data).

### Search Engine Storage
  Storage optimised for indexing, full-text search, and query performance.
  Discusses the storage solutions for full-text search and indexing, often used for large, searchable datasets (e.g., Search Engines like Elasticsearch), unstructured data requiring indexing and search capabilities.


### Archival Storage

Storage optimised for long-term retention and infrequent access.

### Cold Storage
  Cost-efficient storage for archival data and compliance retention.
  Deals with the long-term archival of data that is infrequently accessed but needs to be retained, such as Cold Storage options (e.g., Amazon Glacier, Azure Blob Storage Archive tier).

## Cross-Cutting Storage Capabilities

Storage solutions that apply across multiple storage categories.

### Backup & Disaster Recovery
  Ensures data protection, replication, and recoverability.
  Focuses on ensuring the durability and availability of data through backup, replication, and disaster recovery (e.g., Velero, Veeam, AWS Backup).


### Storage Virtualization
  Abstraction layers enabling hybrid and multi-cloud storage strategies.
  Explores storage abstraction, where multiple physical storage resources can be managed as a unified solution, which is particularly useful in hybrid or multi-cloud environments.(e.g., Portworx, StorageOS).




## Data Storage Systems (Structured or Unstructured Data Repositories)
These platforms serve as persistent data sources for analytics or operations.

| Platform                   | Definition                                                                                      | Role in Data Flow                                                                      |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BigQuery                   | 	Google’s serverless, fully managed data warehouse that supports SQL queries on large datasets. | 	Data Source & Consumer — stores curated data used for analysis and reporting.         |
| Firestore                  | 	NoSQL document-oriented database from Google Cloud, often used for app backends.               | 	Data Source / Producer — collects operational data, often feeding downstream systems. |
| Google Cloud Storage (GCS) | 	Object storage system for unstructured data (e.g., logs, backups, files).                      | 	Data Source / Landing Zone — holds raw or semi-processed data, often before ETL.      |
| AWS S3                     | 	Amazon's equivalent of GCS — object storage for any kind of data.                              | 	Data Source / Landing Zone — same role as GCS.                                        |
| Salesforce Cloud-based     | CRM platform that stores structured customer and sales data.                                    | 	Data Source — holds business-critical data, often extracted for analytics.            |
