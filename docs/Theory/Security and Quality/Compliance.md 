## Security Principles 

1. Build security in, rather than after
2. Implement features securely rather than adding security features
3. Iterating and learning continously over gating decisions
4. Completing a few, over starting many 
5. Empowering technologists, over relying on security specialists (SDL 12)
6. Growing a culture of secure practices, rather than policing for enforcement
