All applications to communicate with each other.

| Protocols    | HTTP /SMTP/TCP                | HTTP                            |
| Requests     | Header, Body, Fault Element   | Get, Post, Put, Delete          |
| Server       | Stateful                      | Stateless                       |

| Message Size | Larger Messages               | Smaller Messages                |


Used by Architectural Patterns: **SOA & Microservices**
- Specialised loosely coupled services
- SOA = larger, coarse-grained, centralised
- Microservices = fine-granes, de-centralised

Each service is discrete. One service can be replaced, enhanced or dropped without affecting any other service in the architecture.

<TabItem value="rest" label="REST">

Representational State Transfer

Interactions are stateless --> Every REST call is independent and can have a global effect

This covers basic properties of interactions, but developers using an API must gain a significant amount of domain knowledge to build applications or pull data effectively. 


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

Query language for application data. This is an alternative to generic REST APIs.

These can retrieve multiple data models in a single request.
- Built around JSON
- Returns data in a shape resembling the JSON Query

REST API uses versioning while GraphQL tags assets as @deprecate if they are no longer in use.


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphQL" label="GraphQL">

This is an alternative to REST APIs.

A user can send a single request with multiple queries. The response is returned in JSON format.

A set of practices and principles for automating software delivery processes, including building, testing, and deploying applications.
Software is built, tested, and released more frequently


| Continuous Integration                                                                         | Continuous Delivery                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Automatically building and unit testing the entire application                                 | Deploying every change to a production-like environment and performs automated integration and acceptance testing to reduce the cost, time, and risk of incremental software releases. |
| Code > Build > Unit Tests > Code Validation > Packaging > Artifact                             | Code > Version Control > CI build > Artifact added to central repo > Staging > Smoke/Integration Testing > Artifact is released to production environment                                                                                     |
| Build must be quicker than it takes to make coffee (5mins)                                     | Only build artifacts once                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Commit really small bits (easier to isolate failures)                                          | Artifacts should be immutable (store & set permissions so immutable - CI system can only write and Deployment only has read access)                                                                                                           |

| Trunk-based development (work from a master branch and frequently commit back to the original) ||

| Build should return status + log + artifact (record of the build run)                          | Development, Test, Potential Staging and final production release are all automated. After testing every change, automatically deploying to production                                                                                        |
