Used by Architectural Patterns: **SOA & Microservices**
- Specialised loosely coupled services
- SOA = larger, coarse-grained, centralised
- Microservices = fine-granes, de-centralised

Each service is discrete. One service can be replaced, enhanced or dropped without affecting any other service in the architecture.

Representational State Transfer

Interactions are stateless --> Every REST call is independent and can have a global effect

This covers basic properties of interactions, but developers using an API must gain a significant amount of domain knowledge to build applications or pull data effectively.

<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

Query language for application data. This is an alternative to generic REST APIs.

These can retrieve multiple data models in a single request.
- Built around JSON
- Returns data in a shape resembling the JSON Query

REST API uses versioning while GraphQL tags assets as @deprecate if they are no longer in use.

<TabItem value="graphQL" label="GraphQL">

This is an alternative to REST APIs.

A user can send a single request with multiple queries. The response is returned in JSON format.
