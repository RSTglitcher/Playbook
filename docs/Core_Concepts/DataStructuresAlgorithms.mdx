## Data Types

| Primitive                                                      | Reference                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pre-defined by programming languages                           | Defined by programmer                                                        |
| Size / Type / No additional Methods                            | Refers to objects (which are in memory locations for storage.)               |
| Casting: Assigns a value of one primitive data type to another | Wrapper: Convert primitive data into objects. Uppercase of primitive values. |
| Widening (Auto)                                                | Character myObject = 9;                                                      |

| integer      | float(input("first: ")) |                                                                             |
| short        |                         |                                                                             |
| byte         |                         |                                                                             |

| string       | string                  | Immutable - Whenever you change a string, you create a new object in memory |
| lists        | (make,a,list)           | Mutable -   Can change the order of items in a list or reassign an items    |
| tuples       | (make,a,tuple)          | Immutable - Cannot be changed once created                                  |
| dictionaries | key,value               | Mutable -  But their keys must be immutable                                 |

| Set            | HashSet (Key,Value)        | Prevents duplicates in collection. Can find elements in collection quickly. Unreliable structure.           | Unordered | Not Allowed   | N      |
|                | LinkedHash Set (Key,Value) | Fast - O(n) notation, representation of speed that a technique is. How many things are happening at a time. | Ordered   | Not Allowed   | N      |
|                | TreeSet                    | Sorted naturally, prevents duplicates.                                                                      | Ordered   | Not Allowed   | Y      |
