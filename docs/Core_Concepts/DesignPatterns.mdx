High level: structure & behaviour of applications

Define relationship between different components and modules

Solve: Overall organisation and composition of the entire system

| Pattern                             | Scalability | Performance | Modifiability | System Complexity |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| MVC - Model-View-Control            |             |             |               |                   |
| LA - Layered Architecture           |             |             |               |                   |
| Microservices                       |             |             |               |                   |
| EDA - Event-Driven-Architecture     |             |             |               |                   |
| SOA - Service-Oriented-Architecture |             |             |               |                   |
| Monolithic Architecture             |             |             |               |                   |


Low level: structure, maintainability & flexibilty of code

Reusable solutions to common design problems

Solve: Implementation level problems

Choose carefully, avoid unnecessary complexity.

| Creational | Structural | Behavioural |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Singleton  | Adapter    | Observer    |
| Factory    | Decorator  | Strategy    |
| Abstract   | Facade     | Command     |
| Builder    | Proxy      | Template    |
