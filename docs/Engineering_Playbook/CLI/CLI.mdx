<TabItem value="tools" label="Complimentary Tools">

These are separate projects which a user would usually choose between. If you use both, it would be typical to isolate
the environments and frequently keep them updated to avoid version conflicts.

##  SDKMAN

Focused on Software Development Kits for different programming languages (Java, Groovy, Scala, Kotlin, Maven, Gradle etc.).
It provides a convenient command-line interface for installing, managing, and switching between different versions of SDKs and tools.

shell
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash # Install sdkman locally
sdk sdk install java 8.0.392-zulu # Install java 8
sdk env install # Install sdkman in environment
sed -i '' 's/sdkman_auto_env=false/sdkman_auto_env=true/g' $HOME/.sdkman/etc/config # Update sdkman config to automatically switch to the correct version when entering the directory



##  ASDF

Focused on more generalised version management for multiple programming languages, runtimes, and tools.  It is not language specific 
and can be extended to support a wide range of languages and tools. It provides a more consistent interface for installing and
managing different versions of runtime environments and tools across various languages. 

shell
brew install asdf # Install ASDF
brew install jenv # Similar to pyenv, this is to manage specific java version for projects
asdf plugin-add java https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java.git #To be able to install java versions with asdf
asdf install java zulu-8.74.0.17
asdf install java zulu-11.68.17
asdf local java  zulu-11.68.17
