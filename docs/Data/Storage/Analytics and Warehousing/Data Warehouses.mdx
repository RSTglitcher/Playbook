## What is a Data Warehouse?

A **data warehouse** is a **centralised analytical data store** designed to support **large-scale, read-heavy analytical queries** across historical data.

### How a Data Warehouse differs from a Database

| Database (OLTP) | Data Warehouse (OLAP) |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Supports day-to-day application operations | Supports analytics, reporting, and decision-making |
| Optimised for small, frequent reads and writes | Optimised for large scans and aggregations |
| Row-based storage | Columnar storage |
| Strong transactional guarantees | Limited or relaxed transactional behaviour |
| Millisecond latency | Seconds-to-minutes latency acceptable |

**Key distinction:**
> A database answers *“What is happening right now?”*
> A data warehouse answers *“What has happened over time?”*

---

## What problem does a Data Warehouse solve?

- Operational databases struggle with large analytical queries
- Analytics workloads can overload production systems
- Historical data needs to be queried efficiently at scale

A data warehouse:
- Offloads analytics from operational systems
- Enables fast aggregation over massive datasets
- Provides a consistent source for reporting and BI tools

---

## When to use a Data Warehouse

Use a data warehouse when you need:

- Analytical queries over large datasets
- Historical trend analysis
- Reporting and dashboards
- Data aggregation across many sources
- Read-heavy workloads

**Common use cases:**
- Business intelligence (BI)
- Data analytics
- Monitoring and metrics analysis
- Financial and product reporting

---

## When *not* to use a Data Warehouse

Avoid using a data warehouse when you need:

- High-frequency transactional writes
- Single-row lookups with low latency
- Frequent updates or deletes
- Strong transactional guarantees

**Anti-patterns:**
- Using a warehouse as an application backend
- Performing per-request queries from user-facing services

---

## Key Terminology & Definitions

- **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):** Query patterns focused on aggregation and analysis
- **Columnar Storage:** Data stored by column for efficient scanning
- **Partitioning:** Dividing data by time or key to limit scanned data
- **Clustering:** Physically organising data to improve query performance
- **ETL / ELT:** Extract, Transform, Load (or Load then Transform)
- **Fact Table:** Stores measurable events (e.g. transactions)
- **Dimension Table:** Stores descriptive attributes (e.g. user, region)

## Key Strategies

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="ingestion" label="Batch & Streaming Ingestion">

  **TA definition:**
  Controlled loading of large volumes of data optimised for analytics, not transactions.

  **Key features:**
  - Append-oriented writes
  - Batch loads or streaming inserts
  - Minimal locking

  **Primary purpose:**
  Efficient ingestion of analytical data at scale

  **Read/Write profile:**
  Write-light, read-heavy

  **Examples:**
  - BigQuery streaming inserts
  - Nightly batch ETL jobs

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="partitioning" label="Partitioning Strategy">

  **TA definition:**
  Organising data by time or key to reduce query scan size.

  **Key features:**
  - Time-based partitions
  - Query pruning
  - Cost reduction

  **Primary purpose:**
  Query performance and cost control

  **Read/Write profile:**
  Read-optimised

  **Examples:**
  - Partitioning BigQuery tables by ingestion date

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="clustering" label="Clustering Strategy">

  **TA definition:**
  Physically grouping related data within partitions.

  **Key features:**
  - Improves filter and join performance
  - Reduces scanned data

  **Primary purpose:**
  Faster analytical queries

  **Read/Write profile:**
  Read-heavy

  **Examples:**
  - Clustering by user_id or region

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="consistency" label="Consistency Model">

  **TA definition:**
  Warehouses prioritise availability and query throughput over strict transactional consistency.

  **Key features:**
  - Eventual consistency acceptable
  - Immutable or append-only data

  **Primary purpose:**
  Analytical correctness over transactional correctness

  **Read/Write profile:**
  Read-heavy

  **Examples:**
  - BigQuery’s append-first model

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## How to interact with a Data Warehouse

- Interaction is **query-based**, not key-based
- Queries typically scan many rows and aggregate results

**Query type:**
- SQL-based analytical queries

**Query content:**
- Aggregations, joins, filters, window functions

**Storage structure:**
- Tables (facts and dimensions)
- Column-oriented storage

---

## What do results normally look like?

- Aggregated datasets
- Summaries and metrics
- Time-series trends
- BI-friendly tables

**Common consumers:**
- Dashboards (Looker, Tableau)
- Scheduled reports
- Data science notebooks
- Downstream analytics pipelines

---

## Common Tools & Examples

- **Google BigQuery**
- **Snowflake**
- **Amazon Redshift**
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**

---

## Where Data Warehouses fit architecturally

Data warehouses typically sit **downstream** of operational systems:
