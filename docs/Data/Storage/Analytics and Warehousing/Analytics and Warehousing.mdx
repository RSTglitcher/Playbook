Data Warehousing Concepts refer to the design, structure, and architecture of a data warehouse, which is a system designed specifically for storing and querying large amounts of historical data for business intelligence and analytics.

These concepts focus on:

Schema Design: The organization of data inside the warehouse, which could follow models like:

Star Schema: Fact tables connected to dimension tables.
- Snowflake Schema: A more normalized version of the star schema where dimension tables are further broken down into related sub-dimensions.
- Galaxy Schema: Complex schema where multiple fact tables share common dimensions.
- Data Modeling: Structuring data for efficient querying and analytics (fact and dimension tables).

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): The process of pulling data from various sources, transforming it into the correct format, and loading it into the data warehouse for analysis.

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing): Techniques used to support complex queries and analytics, such as multidimensional analysis.

Data Aggregation: The process of summarizing data to make it easier to query and analyze, like calculating totals or averages over time.

## Databases & Warehouses

As part of the development of BigQuery, the team designed an abstraction (MapReduce) that allows complex computations to be expressed in terms of two steps:
- `map function` - Processed a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs
- `reduce function` - Merged all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key

This led to the development of **Apache Hadoop**.
