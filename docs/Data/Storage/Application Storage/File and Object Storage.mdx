## Definition

:::tip Definition
**File & Object Storage** refers to storage systems that persist **unstructured or semi-structured data** outside of databases, with access via file paths or object keys.

**Examples:** NFS, Ceph, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, MinIO
:::

---

## Benefit / What problem does it solve?

File and object storage solve these problems:

- **Persistent storage** for applications beyond the lifetime of a process or container
- **Large-scale storage** for media, logs, backups, and datasets
- **Flexible access patterns**, supporting both sequential and random reads/writes
- **Separation of compute and storage**, enabling horizontal scaling

---

## When to Use

**Use File & Object Storage when:**

- Applications require filesystem-like access or object key storage
- Data must survive pod restarts or system failures
- Storing large unstructured datasets (media files, logs, backups)
- Sharing data across multiple services or environments

**Typical examples:**

- Databases storing binary files (BLOBs)
- Media file storage (images, videos)
- Backup and archival
- Cloud-native applications storing logs or artifacts

---

## When Not to Use

**Avoid relying on File/Object Storage when:**

- Low-latency, key-based access is critical (use Cache)
- Complex querying, indexing, or aggregations are needed (use Search Engine Storage)
- Strong ACID transactions are required (use Databases or Data Warehouses)

---

## Key Terminology & Definitions

- **Block Storage:** Low-level raw blocks mounted to hosts, high-performance, usually single-writer
- **File Storage:** Shared filesystem with directories and files, multiple readers/writers
- **Object Storage:** Flat key-based storage for unstructured data, typically immutable
- **Bucket / Container:** Logical namespace for objects in object storage
- **Filesystem:** Hierarchical organization of files and directories
- **Mount Path:** Location where storage is exposed to an application

## Key Strategies

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="tiering" label="Storage Tiering">

- Move data between hot, warm, and cold tiers
- Responsibility: Storage platform or admin
- Focus: Cost optimization and performance

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="replication" label="Replication & Durability">

- Copy data across multiple nodes or regions
- Ensures availability and resiliency
- Responsibility: Storage backend

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="versioning" label="Versioning & Snapshotting">

- Track changes or snapshots of objects/files
- Enables rollback and recovery
- Responsibility: Storage system or application

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="accesscontrol" label="Access Control / IAM">

- Define read/write permissions for users or services
- Responsibility: Platform / admin
- Focus: Security and compliance

## How to Interact With It

- **Access pattern:** Path-based (File Storage) or key-based (Object Storage)
- **Operations:** READ, WRITE, LIST, DELETE, COPY
- **Interfaces:** POSIX filesystem APIs, SDKs, REST APIs, cloud console

**Example (Object Storage - S3):**

```bash
aws s3 cp localfile.txt s3://my-bucket/path/
aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket/path/
aws s3 rm s3://my-bucket/path/localfile.txt
```

### What Do Results Normally Look Like

- Files and directories (file storage)
- Objects with keys and metadata (object storage)
- Large datasets persisted for later analytics, backup, or processing
- Data is not queryable beyond list operations and key/path lookups
