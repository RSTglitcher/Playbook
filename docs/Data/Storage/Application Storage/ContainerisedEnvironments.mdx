:::tip Container & Platform Storage
**Platform-managed persistent storage** for containerised workloads, decoupling data from the lifecycle of individual containers.
Examples: **Kubernetes Persistent Volumes (PV/PVC), CSI drivers, cloud block storage (EBS, Persistent Disk), network filesystems**
:::

### Definition

**Container & platform storage** provides **persistent data storage** for workloads running in container orchestration platforms (most commonly Kubernetes).

Unlike caches, databases, or search engines, this layer:
- Does **not define query semantics**
- Does **not interpret data**
- Focuses on **where and how data is stored**, not how it is queried

Its primary role is to ensure data **survives container restarts, rescheduling, and failures**.

---

### Benefit / What problem does it solve?

Containers are inherently **ephemeral**:
- Pods can restart
- Nodes can be replaced
- Containers can be rescheduled anywhere

Platform storage solves this by:

- **Decoupling data from containers**
- Enabling **stateful workloads** in Kubernetes
- Providing **durability and availability guarantees**
- Standardising how applications request storage

Pod --> Persistent Volume Claim --> Platform Storage --> Physical / Cloud Disk
```

#### When to use

**Use container & platform storage when:**

- Running stateful workloads in Kubernetes
- Data must survive pod restarts
- Applications require filesystem or block storage
- Storage lifecycle should be managed by the platform

**Typical examples:**

- Databases running in Kubernetes
- Message brokers
- CI/CD tooling
- Stateful microservices

---

#### When not to use

**Avoid relying on this layer when:**

- Data is purely temporary
- You need querying, indexing, or aggregation
- Low-latency key-based access is required (use cache)
- Analytics or reporting is the primary workload

**This layer is not:**

- A database
- A cache
- A search engine
- A data warehouse

---

### Key Terminology & Definitions

- Persistent Volume (PV) – Platform-managed storage resource
- Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) – Request for storage by a workload
- StorageClass – Defines how storage is provisioned
- CSI (Container Storage Interface) – Standard interface for storage providers
- StatefulSet – Kubernetes workload type for stateful applications
- Ephemeral storage – Storage lost when a pod terminates

---

### Platform Storage Variants (Access & Scope)

<Tabs> <TabItem value="block" label="Block Storage">

- Raw block devices mounted into containers
- Low latency, high performance
- Typically single-writer
- Examples: Cloud disks (EBS, Persistent Disk)

</TabItem> <TabItem value="file" label="File Storage">

- Shared filesystem
- Multiple readers and writers
- Higher latency than block storage
- Examples: NFS, CephFS

</TabItem> <TabItem value="ephemeral" label="Ephemeral Volumes">

- Tied to pod lifecycle
- No persistence guarantees
- Extremely fast
- Examples: emptyDir volumes

</TabItem> </Tabs>

### Key Strategies
<Tabs> <TabItem value="dynamic" label="Dynamic Provisioning">

- Storage created automatically on demand
- Defined via StorageClasses
- No manual volume management
- Focus: Scalability and operational simplicity

</TabItem> <TabItem value="stateful" label="Stateful Workload Strategy">

- Stable identities for pods
- One-to-one mapping between pod and volume
- Ordered startup and shutdown
- Focus: Safe stateful execution

</TabItem> <TabItem value="snapshot" label="Snapshot & Backup Strategy">

- Volume-level snapshots
- Restore and disaster recovery
- Platform-integrated backups
- Focus: Data protection and resiliency

### How to interact with it

- Access pattern: Declarative
- Interaction model: Infrastructure configuration

**You define:**

- Size
- Access mode (ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany, etc.)
- Performance class

**Example:**

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /data
    name: app-storage
```

**Applications then interact with storage via:**

- Filesystems
- Mounted paths
- Block devices

---

### What do results normally look like

- Files and directories
- Database data files
- Logs, artifacts, binaries
- Raw data blocks

**Important:**
This layer returns no query results — it exposes storage, not data semantics.

### Where Container & Platform Storage fits architecturally

```mermaid

```

**It supports:**

- Databases
- Caches
- Search engines

But does not replace them.
