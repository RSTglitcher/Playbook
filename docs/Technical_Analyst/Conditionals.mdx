:::tip Concept Overview
**Conditionals** define how systems make decisions.

For a Technical Analyst, the goal is not to write conditionals, but to **communicate decision rules clearly**, so engineers can implement them correctly and safely.

# Why Conditionals Matter for a TA

Conditionals drive:

- Feature toggles  
- Workflow branching  
- Data validation  
- Error handling  
- Retry logic  
- Access control  

A TA must be able to:

- Describe **decision rules** unambiguously  
- Highlight **edge cases**  
- Identify **missing conditions**  
- Predict **execution paths**  
- Communicate logic in a way engineers can translate directly into code

# How a TA Communicates Conditional Behaviour

A TA should describe conditional logic using a **structured, implementation‑agnostic format**:

### TA Format: Decision Rule Template
```
WHEN <condition>
AND/OR <additional conditions>
THEN <expected behaviour>
ELSE <fallback behaviour>
```

### Example (TA → Engineer)
**TA description:**
```
WHEN the user is logged in
AND their subscription is active
THEN allow access to premium features
ELSE redirect to the subscription page
```

**Engineer implementation (example in Bash):**
```bash
if [[ $isLoggedIn == true && $subscription == "active" ]]; then
    enable_premium_features
else
    redirect_to_subscription
fi
```

This pairing is the core of the page.

# Conditional Patterns (TA → Engineer)

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="if" label="IF / ELSE">

## 1. IF / ELSE — Binary Decisions

### TA Pattern
```
WHEN <condition>
THEN <action>
ELSE <alternative>
```

### Example (TA)
```
WHEN file size > 10MB
THEN compress before upload
ELSE upload directly
```

### Engineer Implementation
```bash
if [[ $fileSize -gt 10000000 ]]; then
    compress "$file"
else
    upload "$file"
fi
```

---

## 2. IF / ELIF / ELSE — Multi‑branch Decisions

### TA Pattern
```
WHEN <condition A>
THEN <action A>
WHEN <condition B>
THEN <action B>
ELSE <fallback>
```

### Example (TA)
```
WHEN status = "new"
THEN send welcome email

WHEN status = "active"
THEN show dashboard

ELSE show onboarding flow
```

### Engineer Implementation
```bash
if [[ $status == "new" ]]; then
    send_welcome
elif [[ $status == "active" ]]; then
    show_dashboard
else
    show_onboarding
fi
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="case" label="CASE / SWITCH">

# CASE / SWITCH — Category‑Based Decisions

### TA Pattern
```
WHEN value is <category1> → do <action1>
WHEN value is <category2> → do <action2>
OTHERWISE → <fallback>
```

### Example (TA)
```
WHEN file type = "csv" → parse as table
WHEN file type = "json" → parse as object
OTHERWISE → reject file
```

### Engineer Implementation
```bash
case "$fileType" in
    csv)
        parse_csv "$file"
        ;;
    json)
        parse_json "$file"
        ;;
    *)
        reject_file "$file"
        ;;
esac
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="loops" label="Loops (FOR / WHILE / UNTIL)">

# Loops — Repeated Conditional Behaviour

Loops are conditional logic that repeats until a rule changes.

---

## 1. FOR — Known Iteration Count

### TA Pattern
```
FOR EACH <item> IN <collection>
DO <action>
```

### Example (TA)
```
FOR EACH user in the list
DO send reminder email
```

### Engineer Implementation
```bash
for user in "${users[@]}"; do
    send_reminder "$user"
done
```

---

## 2. WHILE — Repeat WHILE condition is true

### TA Pattern
```
WHILE <condition is true>
DO <action>
STOP WHEN <condition becomes false>
```

### Example (TA)
```
WHILE retries < 3
DO attempt connection
STOP WHEN connection succeeds
```

### Engineer Implementation
```bash
while [[ $retries -lt 3 ]]; do
    attempt_connection && break
    ((retries++))
done
```

---

## 3. UNTIL — Repeat UNTIL condition becomes true

### TA Pattern
```
REPEAT <action>
UNTIL <condition becomes true>
```

### Example (TA)
```
REPEAT check queue size
UNTIL queue size = 0
```

### Engineer Implementation
```bash
until [[ $(queue_size) -eq 0 ]]; do
    check_queue
done
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="functions" label="Functions">

# Functions — Encapsulating Conditional Logic

A TA often describes **rules**, and engineers encapsulate them into functions.

### TA Pattern
```
DEFINE function <name>:
    WHEN <condition>
    THEN <action>
    ELSE <fallback>
```

### Example (TA)
```
DEFINE function validate_pin:
    WHEN pin length = 4 AND all digits
    THEN accept
    ELSE reject
```

### Engineer Implementation
```bash
validate_pin() {
    local pin="$1"
    if [[ ${#pin} -eq 4 && $pin =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
        echo "valid"
    else
        echo "invalid"
    fi
}

validate_pin "1234"
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

# TA Checklist for Communicating Conditionals

A TA should ensure:

- All conditions are explicit  
- No ambiguous terms (“usually”, “sometimes”, “if appropriate”)  
- Edge cases are listed  
- Fallback behaviour is defined  
- Order of evaluation is clear  
- Mutually exclusive vs overlapping conditions are identified  
- Failure modes are described  

### TA Example
```
WHEN payment fails due to network error
THEN retry up to 3 times
ELSE IF payment fails due to card decline
THEN notify user
ELSE escalate to support
```
