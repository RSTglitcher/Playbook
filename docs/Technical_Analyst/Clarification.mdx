:::tip Concept Overview
A foundational TA artefact for surfacing, structuring, and stabilising decisions across BAU and project work.

The Decision Surface provides a repeatable structure for:
 - identifying, framing, and documenting decisions.
 - supports clarity, reduces drift.
 - ensures decisions are made by the right people with shared understanding.
:::


## 🧭 When to Use
- When a conversation reveals ambiguity or competing interpretations.
- When a team is blocked by unclear ownership or direction.
- When multiple options exist and trade‑offs must be made.
- When a decision has been made informally and needs to be stabilised.
- During requirement analysis to separate *what must be true* from *what must be chosen*.

## 🧩Decision Surface Template
A structured format for framing decisions before they are made.

**1. Decision Statement**
> - A concise description of the decision to be made.

**2. Context**
> - Relevant background, constraints, and drivers.

**3. Options**
> - List of viable options with brief descriptions.

**4. Evaluation Criteria**
> - Factors used to compare options (e.g., cost, complexity, risk, alignment, effort).

**5. Analysis**
> - Short comparison of each option against the criteria.

**6. Recommendation (Optional)**
> - A suggested option with rationale.

**7. Required Inputs**
> - Information or approvals needed before a decision can be finalised.

**8. Decider & Stakeholders**
> - **Decider:** The person accountable for making the decision.
> - **Consulted:** People whose input is required.
> - **Informed:** People who must know the outcome.

## Decision Log Template

| Date | Decision | Decider | Options Considered | Rationale | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|---------------------|-----------|-------|
| YYYY‑MM‑DD | Short description | Name | Option A, B, C | Summary of why | Follow‑ups or dependencies |

---

## 🧱 Signals a Decision Surface Is Needed
- Repeated conversations with no movement.
- Conflicting interpretations of the same requirement.
- Stakeholders assuming different outcomes.
- Work starting without clarity on direction.
- Emotional or political tension around a choice.

## Example Decision Surface (Generic)

**Decision:** Choose a logging framework for the service.

**Context:** Current logs are inconsistent across services; platform requires structured logs.

**Options:**
- **Option A:** Library X (lightweight, minimal features)
- **Option B:** Library Y (rich features, higher learning curve)
- **Option C:** Keep existing approach

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Ease of adoption
- Compatibility with platform tooling
- Performance
- Maintenance cost

**Analysis:**
- A: Easy to adopt but limited features.
- B: Best alignment with platform; moderate learning curve.
- C: No change but fails to meet platform requirements.

**Recommendation:** Option B.

**Decider:** Engineering Lead

**Consulted:** Platform Team, Senior Engineers

**Informed:** QA, DevOps
