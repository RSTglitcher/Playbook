| **How is memory handled?**                                                                                 | Static Memory Allocation When compiling code, a function is the smallest compilation unit. Whenever a compiler encounters a function, it knows the space required by the current function to use registers and local variables.  | Dynamic Memory Allocation                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Discard objects that have no references pointing to them.  It needs to perform extra logic when marking and freeing memory, which causes STW (Stop The World). Programs can use all the memory they want. Every once in a while, the GC looks to discard objects that have no references pointing to them. To do this, the GC needs to pause execution, and trace the references through the entire program to build an object graph (map all references and how they connect).                                      |
| **How does the program know how much memory space the next function needs before calling it?** - COMPILER  | Fixed: Size & Lifecycle & No Cross-referencing                                                                                                                                                                                   | Dynamic: Size & Lifecycle & Cross-referencing                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Pauses execution & Traces references in program.      Walking through all the references can take time. An optimization of this is getting the GC to run on another thread when possible. The runtime tweaks the GC on the fly based on how fast the GC is working and how much memory is available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

For example, when you create an array, if you do not specify the length of the array in advance, the program will use a basic library function to request a system call to get the memory size.  | Optimise using threads: old & survive = promotion.   They use generations to reduce the amount of work the GC needs to do. Then an object is created, it starts as generation 0. If an object survives a GC because it's in use, it is promoted to generation 1 etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
