## Data Product Management

### Developing Sustainable Data Practices in Organisation

Data is a complex entity and leaders struggle with how to manage and treat the effects of data growth.
The problem for many is that the roles and processes within organisations have yet to evolve to meet the new dynamics of
data storage, flows and safeguarding.

Leaders responsible for data, analytics and information technlogy have an obligation to bring pre-digital organisations to
the digital era, driving appropriate and responsble behaviours in all the workforce. Those who ultimately prioritise data citizenship in information management practices will be set up for long-lasting success.
This keynote will cover data growth challenges and explore how leadership in information management can improve business success and sustainability.

Data Strategy not expressed in a linear journey.

As more data is generated we have become better at managing cost but not the quality for solutions.

Managing cost efficiently/effectively is still an issue.

When cost is basically free, the business strategy focusses on gathering more data for more frivolous features like marketing, sharing videos instead of improving how these are used.

Data Leaders (Welsh for ecosystem kinevan?)

Complicated Vs Simple

Automation Vs manual



Optimisation etc. to resolve/simplify complex problems



Data problems tend to be revealed in an emerging way. Need to develop specific ways or strategies that adapt to evolving/emerging systems and problems.



How do we create conditions for successful operations...not just how do we fix problems.



Data in title -



How are they managing it in the organisation in a coherent manner?

All processes need to be reviewed if they are going to be data driven.



Conclusion -

Steering and influencing rather than controlling

Building trust and support for data functions

Pragmatic linear deliveries

Articulatig the problem clearly to gain trust and support

Keep refreshing relevance. Multi year projects risks irrelevancy

Invest is forecasting next steps for planning and relevancy. What conditions need to be accounted for.



Data growth, data storage, data strategy





Adapt

Shut down things that don't work

Communicate value especially with stakeholders



Q&A

What am I doing today to avoid putting tech debt on the next person?

Evergreening should be part of the process, not optional

Make the invisible, visible - people can't understand what they can't see so Comms are hindered

Things that function well can deliver value better. Not always about the latest tech, but reflect on ways of working. Mae sure you have good working practices in place.

Legacy can present itself as bad data, slow processes etc. but it's not always about the tech but the legacy tech reflects ways of working.


## Data Frenzy to data freedom: How Centralised Data Powers Innovation

In today&rsquo;s data-rich environment, companies face the challenge of centralising large volumes of diverse data to drive insights and operational efficiency. Without a comprehensive data centralisation strategy, organisations risk missing out on significant opportunities for revenue growth and competitive advantages with data trapped in silos. By freeing data from silos and establishing a single source of truth, companies can accelerate their innovation to stay competitive.Join us as we explore how data freedom powers analytics, operations and AI/ML with all your data - including on-prem databases, SaaS applications, and enterprise systems like SAP. In our talk, you will discover: &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key obstacles hindering organizations from achieving a mature data strategy &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learn how a strong cloud data platform can serve as a catalyst for data freedom&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear about real-world examples where embracing data centralization led to deeper innovation&nbsp;


Data scattered but how do you organise it for usage?

Want to build and AI model, but projects get stuck due to lack of data. Fivetran helps deliver the data from a variety of data sources.

Large language models run in the data. Fivetran automates the data movement.

Data sources

Integration

Platform

Target

Destination

Transformation

Output

Partnered with various tools e.g. Bigquery, Snowflake etc.

Before:

20 percent effort analysis, 80perfent buidl

After:

80 percent analysis, 20 percent build

Data centralisation

Data needs to move on a new around the business

Data has to be available for usag

Time spent engineers to make data available and ready is time taken away from making good business decisions

Governance, security are vital - need to be set up to comply

DBT is a transformation tool used to create data models and save people the time of creating it themselves.

automate schema when they keep on chnaging


Data cataloging

Protect data from those who shouldn't have access

Done at platform level as the data is moving

SAP data freedom

Log-based CDC

Use deltas to bring data across rather usingthe entire file or data transfer every time.
